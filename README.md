# OpenGL Project
 C++ application that uses OpenGL to render various objects and textures based on a 2D scene. I've implemented the Phong lighting model to the fragment shader, which allows the user to view dynamic lighting that they can control with arrow keys. Application.cpp contains controls for application.
